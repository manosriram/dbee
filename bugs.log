[x] insert writes to existing space
[x] cursor is not being set to the right position before insertion
[x] cursor cell and page navigation is not clear, should fix this (maybe cursor_at_table_end() before insertion should work)

[ ] btree children are not being linked when splitting
[ ] root node offset not clear
